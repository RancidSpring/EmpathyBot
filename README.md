# EmpathyBot
Pepper robot emotion recognition and corresponding gesture reaction

# Goals for Development
- **Face recognition**: use OpenCV or similar (do research)
- **Find and implement suitable emotion recognition model**: use pytorch (do research, maybe Unet)
- **Investigate naoqi**: find out the parameters of the photos from the Pepper
- **Think of the way empathy is translated to gesture**: what is a best answer to the specific emotion. Introduce a set of gestures.
- **Code the movements**: transfer gestures to the code driven the robot's movements
